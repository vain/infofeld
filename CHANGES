Release history for infofeld

next
  [Changed]
  - infofeld-temperature is now drawn as a simple line graph, because it
    can show more details this way.
  - infofeld-memory is now drawn using floating point values and is thus
    using "antialiasing". This makes it a tiny bit more accurate.

  [Added]
  - infofeld-gwping was added. It sends ICMP ping requests to your
    current default gateway and plots their response time (or packet
    loss).
  - infofeld-battery was added. It plots the remaining capacity of your
    battery (if present).

v16.10  2016-10-29
  [Fixed]
  - Sun graph: Twilight is more accurate, i.e. it ends with sun rise and
    begins with sun set. Previously, there was a twilight zone after sun
    rise and before sun set, which simply is not the definition of
    twilight.

  [Added]
  - Memory graph takes size of ZFS ARC into account (ZFS on Linux only),
    if that information is available.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Fixed]
  - Parentheses error in temperature graph.

  [Added]
  - The temperature graph plots the values with an extra margin at the
    top. This margin can now be customized.
