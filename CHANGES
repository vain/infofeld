  [Fixed]
  - Sun graph: Twilight is more accurate, i.e. it ends with sun rise and
    begins with sun set. Previously, there was a twilight zone after sun
    rise and before sun set, which simply is not the definition of
    twilight.

  [Added]
  - Memory graph takes size of ZFS ARC into account (ZFS on Linux only),
    if that information is available.
