Release history for infofeld

next
  [Changed]
  - infofeld-battery now exits with an exit code other than 0, if there
    is no battery in the system.

v17.12  2017-12-23
  [Fixed]
  - infofeld-sun: Fix rounding errors. Might have shown "7:60" instead
    of "8:00".

  [Changed]
  - Memory graph no longer tries to account for ZFS ARC size.

  [Added]
  - Memory graph now draws a label showing the amount of available
    memory.

v17.11  2017-11-16
  [Fixed]
  - Fix sign error in infofeld-sun. Sun set and sun rise have been quite
    off during some periods of the year.
  - infofeld-sun: We now use round() instead of a simple int() to
    display sun set and sun rise. This should be slightly more accurate.

  [Changed]
  - infofeld-sun now draws a little circular "clock". This is much
    easier to comprehend than the previous linear view.

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.07  2017-07-02
  [Changed]
  - Battery capacity is now show relative to design values. Older
    batteries will not show "100%" anymore.

v17.06  2017-06-10
  [Changed]
  - infofeld-temperature is now drawn as a simple line graph, because it
    can show more details this way.
  - infofeld-memory is now drawn using floating point values and is thus
    using "antialiasing". This makes it a tiny bit more accurate.

  [Added]
  - infofeld-gwping was added. It sends ICMP ping requests to your
    current default gateway and plots their response time (or packet
    loss).
  - infofeld-battery was added. It plots the remaining capacity of your
    battery (if present).

v16.10  2016-10-29
  [Fixed]
  - Sun graph: Twilight is more accurate, i.e. it ends with sun rise and
    begins with sun set. Previously, there was a twilight zone after sun
    rise and before sun set, which simply is not the definition of
    twilight.

  [Added]
  - Memory graph takes size of ZFS ARC into account (ZFS on Linux only),
    if that information is available.

v16.09  2016-09-03
  [Fixed]
  - Parentheses error in temperature graph.

  [Added]
  - The temperature graph plots the values with an extra margin at the
    top. This margin can now be customized.

    - cpu
