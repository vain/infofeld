A set of short scripts to create system information graphics. The output
format is farbfeld[0], so these scripts can be used in bevelbar[1].

Installation
------------

Dependencies:

    - Python 3 Cairo bindings (package python-cairo in Arch Linux)
    - Linux procfs and sysfs
    - farbfeld tools (png2ff)
    - wlinfo (https://github.com/vain/wlinfo) for the WiFi graph

Clone this repo and make it available in your $PATH. You will most
likely not call any of these scripts interactively but from a wrapper
script. Thus, it's sufficient to change $PATH only inside of that
wrapper. See below.


Running
-------

The individual scripts write a farbfeld image to stdout. What you do
with that is up to you.
